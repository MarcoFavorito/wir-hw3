MODEL SELECTION (Part 2)

from IIR, cap. 15, introduction

Improving classifier effectiveness has been an area of intensive machine-
learning research over the last two decades, and this work has led to a new
generation of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as support vector machines,
boosted decision trees, regularized logistic regression, neural networks, and
random forests. Many of these methods, including support vector machines
(SVMs), the main topic of this chapter, have been applied with success to
information retrieval problems, particularly text classification. An SVM is a
kind of large-margin classifier: it is a vector space based machine learning
method where the goal is to find a decision boundary between two classes
that is maximally far from any point in the training data (possibly discount-
ing some points as outliers or noise).

"""
As per my searches, I found a paper [1] which compares various approaches of text classification.
They have experimented with K-NN, decision tree, Naive Bayes, Rocchio’s Algorithm,
Back-propagation NN and SVM. Eventually, SVM was found to be best performing approach
in terms of precision, but involved large computation time. They also tried multiple combinations
